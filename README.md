[OSPP 2023 Challenge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/discussions/2452)


## Progress

- 2023-07-05 Start working on rewriting SIMD related parts.


### 2023-07-08 int128Test.cpp `error C2593: 'operator ~' is ambiguous`

Somehow, the 32bit related logic in `include\common\int128.h` is compiled, probably because the `defined(__x86_64__)` is false. In MSVC, it seems to be `_WIN64` or `_M_X64`.

There seems [no __int128 equivalent in MSVC](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6759592/how-to-enable-int128-on-visual-studio)

[_MSC_VER is also defined by MSVC clang](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67406228/clang-on-windows-how-to-disable-the-default-msvc-compatibility) and 

some unused code: 
```C++
  friend constexpr uint128_t operator*(uint128_t LHS, long long RHS) noexcept {
    return LHS * uint128_t(RHS);
  }
  friend constexpr uint128_t operator*(long long LHS, uint128_t RHS) noexcept {
    return uint128_t(LHS) * RHS;
  }
```

### 2023-07-06 attribute 'gnu::always_inline' is not recognized

The replacement seems to be [`__forceinline`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/inline-functions-cpp?view=msvc-170)

> You can't force the compiler to inline a particular function, even with the __forceinline keyword. When you compile with /clr, the compiler won't inline a function if there are security attributes applied to the function.

### 2023-07-02 `[[gnu::vector_size(16)]]`

I found another important issue that, MSVC does not support attribute `[[gnu::vector_size(16)]]`, and [there seems no direct replacement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29435394/replacement-of-typedef-int64-t-x-t-attribute-vector-size16). I found this [OpenMP SIMD Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/parallel/openmp/openmp-simd?view=msvc-170) which is very different from the extension.

- For example, this code, MSVC first report a warning that the attribute `[[gnu::vector_size(16)]]` is unknown. Probably `int32x8_t` directly becomes `int32_t`

https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/9a9401fc1413e895a9588533d3cf05d5f389eb4e/include/executor/engine/binary_numeric.ipp#L581-L593

- the arithmetic of these vector types seems to be used a lot (`EV1 * EV2` in the above code, in the following code, and many more), which will do the arithmetic for each element in the array according to [gcc vector extension](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.1/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html#Vector-Extensions). If MSVC equivalent cannot be found, probably we have to rewrite all these operations for MSVC? We can either rewrite these using loop and hope for the compiler to optimize it to use SIMD instructions, or implement a class (or structure) that override these operations support these operations? I don't know...

### gtest build error

gtest have `-WX`(regard all warning as error) in their compiler flags (in `build\_deps\gtest-src\googletest\cmake\internal_utils.cmake:75`), but there are still many warnings (which become errors). 

Current solution: supress many warnings in `WasmEdge\test\CMakeLists.txt`.

### log other issues

1. Equivalent flag for `-Wall` `-Wno-xxx` 

    Reference: [MSVC C++ Warning levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level?view=msvc-170). 

    - For `-Wall` there is `/Wall`.
    - For `-Wextra`, there seems no equivalent flag?
    - For `-Werror`, there is `/WX`.

1. Use `if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "MSVC")` or `if(MSVC)` in cmake.

    It seems better to use `if(MSVC)`. [ref](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/issues/160)

## Challenge

https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/discussions/2452

1. Challenge1: Use Clang on Windows to build and run tests
1. Challenge2: Try using MSVC to build.


### Challenges

### Challenge2: Try using MSVC to build

To use MSVC to build, I installed MSVC 14.34.31933, and removed `$Env:CC = "clang-cl"` and `$Env:CXX = "clang-cl"` in the build script, and add `-vcvars_ver=14.34.31933`.

```
# Remove-Item -LiteralPath "build" -Force -Recurse
$vsPath = (&"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -latest -property installationPath)
Import-Module (Join-Path $vsPath "Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll")
Enter-VsDevShell -VsInstallPath $vsPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments "-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 -winsdk=10.0.19041.0 -vcvars_ver=14.34.31933"
$llvm_dir = "C:\\Users\\warren\\my_programs\\LLVM-13.0.1-win64\\lib\\cmake\\llvm"
# $Env:CC = "cl.exe"
# $Env:CXX = "cl"

cmake -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION="10.0.19041.0" -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDLL "-DLLVM_DIR=$llvm_dir" -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_PACKAGE="ZIP" .
cmake --build build
```

the first error encountered is:
```
cl : Command line error D8021 : invalid numeric argument '/Wextra'
```

TODO:
1. When the compiler is MSVC, not add unsupported flags to `WASMEDGE_CFLAGS`, and find equivalent flags instead.
1. try to find equivalent code in MSVC for [the `int128.h` issue](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2419)

### Challenge1: Use Clang on Windows to build and run tests


#### Install Dependencies & Build

CMake is already installed on my computer.
1. Install latest cmake and select the option that add cmake to path.
1. Download the LLVM fork from https://github.com/WasmEdge/llvm-windows . **Do not use llvm official release and do not add its `bin` to path**.
1. Open `LLVM-13.0.1-win64\lib\cmake\llvm\LLVMExports.cmake` and search for `diaguids`, and change from `Enterprise` to `Community`.
1. Use Visual Studio Installer to install Windows SDK and MSVC. Change Win 11 SDK to Win 10 SDK 10.0.19041.0. **Select Clang 15 and use this as compiler!!**
1. `vswhere` seems to be already included in Visual Studio Installer. Change its occurrence to absolute path.

Clone the code and check out to `0.12.0`. Follow the instructions: https://wasmedge.org/book/en/contribute/build_from_src/windows.html but add some more cmake flags.

Build script below:
```
$vsPath = (&"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -latest -property installationPath)
Import-Module (Join-Path $vsPath "Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll")
Enter-VsDevShell -VsInstallPath $vsPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments "-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 -winsdk=10.0.19041.0 -vcvars_ver=14.33.31629"

$llvm_dir = "C:\\Users\\warren\\my_programs\\LLVM-13.0.1-win64\\lib\\cmake\\llvm"
$Env:CC = "clang-cl"
$Env:CXX = "clang-cl"

cmake -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION="10.0.19041.0" -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDLL "-DLLVM_DIR=$llvm_dir" -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_PACKAGE="ZIP" .
if ($?) {
    cmake --build build
}

if ($?) {
    $Env:PATH += ";$pwd\\build\\lib\\api"
    cd build
    ctest --output-on-failure
    cd ..
}
```

the output saved using `2>&1 > out.txt` are uploaded as `clang-build.txt`.

**installing LLVM**
during decompressing the llvm zip file, I notice that `clang-cl.exe` `clang++.exe` are actually symbolic links. If I use explorer to decompress the file, the symbolic links seems broken. I started 7zip file manager with administrator privilege to decompress it, and the result seems to replace the symlink with another copy of the target.

#### test

Follow https://wasmedge.org/book/en/contribute/build_from_src/windows.html#run-tests and all test passed.

![test passed](clang-run-test.png)

##### `Cannot Compile simple program using std::filesystem`

tldr: Do not add the downloaded clang 13 to compile (do not add it to PATH), use clang 15 from Visual Studio Installer instead!!! (it will be automatically added to path when you enter dev shell.)

A few days ago, I can successfully compile, but when I come back to this today, this new error occurred. To debug cmake output, I added `--debug-output` to cmake flags. I found a line in CMakeError.log.

```
In file included from C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.35.32215\include\filesystem:9:

_EMIT_STL_ERROR(STL1000, "Unexpected compiler version, expected Clang 15.0.0 or newer.");

    static_assert(false, "Error in C++ Standard Library usage.")

    ^             ~~~~~

1 error generated.

ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
```

`filesystem` header is actually found. I need to downgrade MSVC version. But uninstall latest version seems to introduce more problem, so keep the newer version and try to specify MSVC version used. Downgrade to MSVC v142 (2019) will trigger another error, so I tried several previous version of MSVC v143.

According to `Get-Help Enter-VsDevShell` and `VsDevCmd.bat /help`, add `-vcvars_ver=14.29.30133`. Open `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC` to find out MSVC versions. Finally `14.33.31629` can work.

```
Enter-VsDevShell -VsInstallPath $vsPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments "-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 -winsdk=10.0.19041.0 -vcvars_ver=14.33.31629"
```

However, Some tests failed.

```
The following tests FAILED:
          8 - wasmedgeExecutorCoreTests (Failed)
         11 - wasmedgeAPIVMCoreTests (Failed)
         12 - wasmedgeAPIStepsCoreTests (Failed)

After A few days' trying and error, I finally find out that, I should't use the downloaded clang 13 to compile, use clang 15 from Visual Studio Installer instead!!!

TODO



##### No tests were found!!!

2023-05-13 When I check out to latest tag: `0.12.1`, I got this error.



##### some test failed due to `std::filesystem`



##### 2023-05-10 summary

- The MSVC runtime library for LLVM should be the same with WasmEdge.
- There is an hard-coded library path for `diaguids.lib` in LLVM's cmake file.
To solve these two issue without upgrading llvm version, it seems that [forking llvm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/llvm-windows) and recompile is the only way.

##### `lld-link: error: undefined symbol: __std_init_once_link_alternate_names_and_abort`

Previously my Visual Studio version is 2019. Upgrading to 2022 solves the issue.

According to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73749984/qt-6-3-2-compilation-issue)
> it could not find this new function: __std_init_once_link_alternate_names_and_abort. This function is from STL's import library: msvcprt.lib and was only added in the VS 2022 version: 17.2.5.

##### `ninja: error: 'C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Enterprise/DIA SDK/lib/amd64/diaguids.lib', needed by 'test/aot/wasmedgeAOTCoreTests.exe', missing and no known rule to make it`

Found a related issue: https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1290

Edit `C:\Users\warren\my_programs\LLVM-13.0.1-win64\lib\cmake\llvm\LLVMExports.cmake` and search for `diaguids`, and change from `Enterprise` to `Community`.


##### `llvm-mt: error: no libxml2`

tldr: this error disappeared after my environment changed, but if it exist, you can add the flags.

There is an error said: `llvm-mt: error: no libxml2`. This [issue](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/cannot-cmake-self-hosted-clang-on-windows-for-lack-of-libxml2/58793), 

Changing cmake version doesn't seems to work.
~~I decided to first upgrade my cmake (from 3.21.1) to latest([3.26.3](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3-windows-x86_64.msi)).~~

- https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay/issues/458

Finally I think I have to add the following to cmake flags:
```
-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="/manifest:no" -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS="/manifest:no" -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS="/manifest:no"
```
